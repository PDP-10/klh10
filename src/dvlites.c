/*
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *   To a programmer, the Panda Display appears as a file of eight byte wide
 * registers.  The PC can write a register by sending the desired data to the
 * parallel port data bit, selecting the desired register address with the
 * INIT, AUTO LF, and SELECT IN printer status signals, and the clocking the
 * printer STROBE signal. The Panda Display registers are write only - there's
 * no way for the PC to ever read back from the display.  In this file, the
 * WriteRegister() method takes care of all the mechanics of writing a byte
 * to an individual register.
 *
 *   The first five registers, numbers 0..4, correspond to the forty data LEDs.
 * Register 0 is the left most block of eight LEDs, and register 5 the right
 * most.  The MSB of each byte is the left most LED of the block and the LSB
 * the right - pretty much what you'd expect.  This isn't rocket science!
 *
 *   Register 5 controls the four status LEDs.  Bit 7 (the MSB) controls LED1,
 * bit 6 LED2, bit 5 LED3 and finally, bit 4 controls LED4.  The lower four
 * bits of this register are currently unused.
 *
 *   Register 6 is the display enable register - writing a 1 to the LSB of this
 * register turns on the main forty data LEDs, and writing a 0 turns them off.
 * The powerup state of this register (nor any of the others, for that matter)
 * is not guaranteed, so the software should always initialize this register.
 * Currently only the LSB of register 6 is used - the remaining 7 bits are
 * ignored and should be zero.  The display enable flag affects ONLY the main
 * data LEDs - it has no effect on the four status LEDs.  Disabling the display
 * has no effect on the data currently stored in registers 0..4 nor does it
 * prevent the software from loading new data in these registers; it simply
 * turns off the LED drivers.  Finally, note that this register is NOT affected
 * by the unit selection (see register 7) - any writes to register 6 will
 * change _all_ displays in the system at the same time.
 *
 *   It's possible (if you're a really rabid blinking lights kinda person) to
 * have up to four Panda Displays daisy chained on the same parallel port.
 * Each display has a unique two bit address assigned to it by jumpers JP1/2,
 * and register 7 is used to select the active display unit.  The software
 * should write a two bit unit select code to bits 6 and 7 (the LSBs) of this
 * register and the display with the matching jumper settings will be selected.
 *
 *	JP2		JP1		Unit
 *	---------	---------	----
 *	removed		removed		0
 *	removed		installed	1
 *	installed	removed		2
 *	installed	installed	3
 *
 *   Only the selected Panda Display will respond to writing registers 0..5.
 * All unselected displays will ignore any writes to these registers. Registers
 * 6 and 7 are always enabled regardless of the unit selected and any writes to
 * these registers will affect all displays simultaneously. Finally, remember
 * that this register doesn't have any guaranteed state after power up, so the
 * software should always select a display as the first step.
