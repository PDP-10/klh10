	FE to KS10 communication routines.

	From arduous trial and error it appears that the FE <-> KS10
interrupt mechanism exists primarily to handle console TTY I/O.

	The FE interrupts the KS10 (sets APRF_FEINT) whenever it has
placed an input character in FECOM_CTYIN.  The KS10 then reads this
word, if non-zero, and clears it.  The FE won't (or shouldn't)
send another char until that location is zero.
[Actually, TOPS-20 relies on it checking only the "valid" bit, 0400]

	The KS10 clears the APRF_FEINT flag, but since it does this
before reading the input character from FECOM_CTYIN, this event
cannot be used to trigger new input checks.

	The KS10 interrupts the FE (sets APRF_INT80 momentarily) whenever
it has placed an output character in FECOM_CTYOT (033).  The FE
picks it up if non-zero, then clears the word.  IT THEN INTERRUPTS
THE KS10 BY SETTING APRF_FEINT to signal its readiness for more.
The only thing distinguishing this from the CTY-input case is the
fact that FECOM_CTYIN is clear; however, a single interrupt may
signal both situations (CTY input waiting, and CTY output ready).

	Unfortunately, the same situation is not true for the other (input)
direction, since the KS10 doesn't bother to set any signal flag when
it's gobbled the input character.  The FE must continually check to
see if FECOM_CTYIN is clear.  Barf.

Actually, T20 does this a bit differently.  It appears that T20
sends a FE interrupt pulse whenever it changes anything, either
when reading a char from CTYIN (T20 merely clears the valid bit, 0400),
or when a validated char has been deposited in CTYOT.
T20 also expects to receive a KS10 interrupt from the FE whenever
the FE has changed anything - this can indicate either that a new
validated char is in CTYIN, or that a char was removed (and invalidated)
from CTYOT.

/* FE_INTRUP - Called from WRAPR (CONO PI,) when a FE interrupt is requested
**	by the KS10 - the KS10 has changed something in the com area.
**
**	Note gross hack here to delay output for a T20 KS.
** Apparently, T20 can't cope with the fact that the KLH10 responds
** "instantaneously", generating a FE->KS interrupt to acknowledge that
** the output char has been gobbled.  The T20 code isn't prepared for
** this until it has executed something like 50 more instructions; it
** will handle the interrupt, but then thinks it needs to wait for
** an interrupt (not knowing that it already arrived and was handled!)
** and stalls.
**	Two workarounds are supported.  The first uses fe_iowait
** (called "cty_iowait" in the UI) to delay at least 50 instructions
** after gobbling output before giving T20 its interrupt.  This works,
** but slows things a lot when using a real-time clock emulation.
**	The second uses cty_lastint to give T20 an extra interrupt
** some amount of time after the last output char of a bufferful has
** gone out.  This is more efficient.
**
**	Obviously the right thing is to fix T20, but we have to support
**	unmodified monitor binaries.
