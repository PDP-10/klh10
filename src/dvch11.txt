================================
  CHAOS is restored!
   or
  CH11 support for ITS in KLH10
================================

The ch11 device in KLH10 for ITS, which was originally just a dummy
inteface to keep ITS running, is now a functional Unibus Chaosnet
device, which supports Chaosnet-on-Ethernet and Chaosnet-over-UDP.  
It does not support SPY (promiscuous) mode, or LUP (loopback), but ITS
doesn't seem to use/need these. 

Latest update: 2021-02-23

Like other KLH10 network devices, ch11 works together with a Device
Process which communicates with the device and reads/writes network
data. It can do it in two ways:

Firstly, by implementing Chaosnet over Ethernet (protocol nr 0x0804) and handling
ARP for that protocol (cf RFC 826). This uses one of the packet filtering
implementations (currently only pcap) provided by osdnet. (Only Ethernet II
headers are supported, not 802.3.)
No routing is handled, that's done by ITS - this code uses the
Chaosnet trailer provided by ITS to decide where to send pkts. 
(On Ethernet, no Chaosnet trailer is included.)

Secondly, it can do it by using a Chaos-over-UDP tunnel. A 4-byte
protocol header is added, with only one defined function code yet
(sending a Chaos packet). The "original" Chaos trailer (destination,
source, and checksum) is also added.

The protocol, CHUDP, by default uses UDP port 42042, but this can be
configured in case, e.g., that port doesn't pass through your
firewall.

Configuration parameters:

The basic configuration parameters:
    devdef chaos ub3  ch11 addr=764140 br=6 vec=270

ITS seems to think the "br" param should be 6, not 5 as used in the
old dummy device definition (see CHXCHN in ITS).

More parameters:

    myaddr=oooo
	defines the octal Chaosnet address of the interface. 
	This needs to match the address configured in ITS (see MYCHAD
	in SYSTEM;CONFIG >)
    ifmeth=meth
	where meth is "chudp" or "pcap", selects the link
	implementation to use (Chaos-over-UDP or Chaos-on-Ethernet).
For "chudp":
    chudpport=dddddd
	sets the local UDP port to use for Chaos-over-UDP. The default is 42042.
    chip=oooo/hhhhhhhh
	defines a remote Chaos-over-UDP host with the octal Chaos address oooo,
	and the IPv4 address or hostname hhhhhhhh. If a hostname is
	used, the first IPv4 address returned is used. (Rather than
	listing all your friends' ITS hosts directly, I suggest joining the
	Global Chaosnet and just list its central router. See
	https://chaosnet.net.)

If chudpport or chip parameters are given, the ifmeth defaults to chudp,
otherwise to pcap.

If a CHUDP packet is received from an unknown host, a Chaos/IP mapping
is dynamically added to the table, so return traffic can find its way. 
This is useful e.g. if you accept connections from other ITSes without
static IP addresses. (You can avoid this feature, and potentially
filling your table, by using a firewall.)

To make use of the interface, you need to recompile ITS after defining
CHAOSP, MYCHAD, NINDX, and CH11P in SYSTEM;CONFIG (and following the
instructions in distrib.its, of course).  See also BEWARE note below.
Don't forget to compile SYSENG;@CHAOS and install as DEVICE;ATSIGN
CHAOS.  Don't forget to keep names of your friends' ITSes in
SYSEN2;MLDEV, SYSENG;@DEV, etc.  

*BEWARE*:
If you have both CHAOSP and IMPP, you run into a bug which results in
all non-local IP packets being routed via Chaosnet... (unfortunately
noone is listenting at Chaos address 3040).  
The bug is caused by the IPMASK macro defined and used in
SYSTEM;CONFIG, which results in the netmask NM%CHA being zero, which
matches anything.  The easy fix is to change the line
IFN CHAOSP,DEFOPT NM%CHA==<IPMASK IMPUS4>	; Set default netmask for it
to
IFN CHAOSP,DEFOPT NM%CHA==<IPADDR 255,255,0,0>	; Set default netmask for it
but the real fix would be to the IPMASK macro.
